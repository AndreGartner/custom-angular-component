# CustomAngularComponent

This project has the intention to learn About Angular Animations on a custom Component.

And was inspired by this article: `https://dev.to/mustapha/all-you-need-to-know-about-angular-animations-1c09`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
